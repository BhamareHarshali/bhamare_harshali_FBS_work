#2 .Write a program to calculate area of rectangle based on length and breadth.

length = int(input("Enter the length of ractangle : "))
breadth = int(input("Enter the breadth of ractangle : "))

area = length * breadth  #l*b 

#Display output 
print(f'area of {length} and {breadth} is {area}')
